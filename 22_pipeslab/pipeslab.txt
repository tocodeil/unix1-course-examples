For each of the following, type a single command line that performs:

 
 1. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner.
  Answer: 

 

ls -l | cut -d- -f1 |grep d |wc -l 

or

ls -l |grep drwxr|wc -l


 2. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner, group and others.

ls -l | grep x" " |wc -l

 
3. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent paths that were modified today (no matter which day we run the command)
  Answer: 

 

ls -l |grep Jun | grep -n 2 | wc -l

4. Modify (1) and (2) to count files only (no directories)
  Answer:

  
1. ls -l |cut -c1 | grep - |wc -l
2. ls -l |cut -c1,10 |grep ^[-r]*[x] | wc -l ---> Im sure there is a nicer way to do it, ut I can't manage to find it 

5. The command /sbin/ifconfig shows information regarding the machine's network interfaces. 
Use the command to print only the IP address of the machine. Remember not to show the special loopback address 127.0.0.1

6. 

I don't have such command..

Joe wanted to sort a text file in place so he tried to run the command "sort myfile.txt > myfile.txt". 
What happened to the file? Why?




He overwrote the file because sort won't change the file itself, it can print it out


7. The command "who" shows all connected users along with the connection start date. 

For example running it on my machine gives:

$ who
ynonperek console  Nov 18 16:29 
ynonperek ttys000  Dec 10 11:58 
ynonperek ttys001  Nov 20 08:35 
ynonperek ttys005  Dec 10 17:04 


I want to show how many connections began in each month so I tried to run the command:
$ who | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c

What was printed? 
Why? the -f isn't correct, it shows an empty space 

Fix the command line to get the output:
2 Dec
2 Nov


who | cut -d" " -f14 |sort|uniq -c
