For each of the following, type a single command line that performs:

  1. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner.
  Answer: 
I used ls -la to get all the content (including hidden)
It works for me in such way:

$ ls -la | cut -c 4 | grep x | cat -n | tail -1 | cut -f1

or, using regex:

$ ls -la | grep  '^...x' | cat -n | cut -f1 | tail -1

But shorter is:

$ ls -la | grep  '^...x' | wc -l

  2. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner, group and others.
  Answer: 
$ ls -la | cut -c 4,7,10 | grep xxx | wc -l

or

$ ls -la | grep  '^...x..x..x' | wc -l

  3. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent paths that were modified today (no matter which day we run the command)
  Answer: 
$ export LC_ALL=C
$ ls -la | grep "$(date +"%b %d")"

  4. Modify (1) and (2) to count files only (no directories)
  Answer:
1. $ ls -la -p | grep -v / | cut -c 4 | grep x | wc -l

2. $ ls -la -p | grep -v / | cut -c 4,7,10 | grep xxx | wc -l


  5. The command /sbin/ifconfig shows information regarding the machine's network interfaces. Use the command to print only the IP address of the machine. Remember not to show the special loopback address 127.0.0.1

$ /sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet addr' | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d B | tr -d a-z | cut -f2 -d :

6. Joe wanted to sort a text file in place so he tried to run the command "sort myfile.txt > myfile.txt". What happened to the file? Why?

Redirection is a shell's commands and has a priority over programms' (like sort etc). In order to the output file be open for writing: it's created, if does not exist or emptied, if has any previous content. Good way to empty a file, but save the file with this name (for futures filling)

7. The command "who" shows all connected users along with the connection start date. For example running it on my machine gives:

$ who
ynonperek console  Nov 18 16:29 
ynonperek ttys000  Dec 10 11:58 
ynonperek ttys001  Nov 20 08:35 
ynonperek ttys005  Dec 10 17:04 

I want to show how many connections began in each month so I tried to run the command:
$ who | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c

What was printed? Why? Fix the command line to get the output:
2 Dec
2 Nov

$ who | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c
