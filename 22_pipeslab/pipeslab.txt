For each of the following, type a single command line that performs:

  1. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner.
  Answer: 
	ls -l|grep $USER| cut -c 4|grep x|wc -w
	[Q: Based on the commands we know by now is there a shorter way to do 	this? With less pipes?] 

  2. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner, group and others.
  Answer: 
	ls -l|grep $USER| cut -c 4,7,10|grep x|wc -w

  3. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent paths that were modified today (no matter which day we run the command)
  Answer: 
	
	ls -l | cut -f6-8 -d" "| grep $(date +%b" "%d)| wc -l
	
	[Note: this answer is not working because date +%d return an answer for 	today day as 07 (two char) and in ls print it's only 7(one char)
	I could check with or and add the “0” char if need but I think you are 	looking for a different answer?
	Just in case when checking with the string “Jun 07” it's working but I 	know it's not what we are looking for,
	Also I had a problem when cutting date from folders, the colums where 	different with the date comapared to file? I am not sure for the reason? 

	Below an answer where I used a set date for today:
	ls -l | cut -f6-8 -d" "| grep "Jun  7"| wc -l (working)
	]

  4. Modify (1) and (2) to count files only (no directories)
  Answer:

	(1) ls -l|grep $USER|cut -c 1-4|grep x |cut -c1 | grep - | wc -l
	(2) ls -l|grep $USER|cut -c 1,4,7,10|grep x| cut -c1 | grep -|wc -w


  5. The command /sbin/ifconfig shows information regarding the machine's network interfaces. Use the command to print only the IP address of the machine. Remember not to show the special loopback address 127.0.0.1

	/sbin/ifconfig | tr -s " " | cut -f3 -d" " | grep addr | head -1

6. Joe wanted to sort a text file in place so he tried to run the command "sort myfile.txt > myfile.txt". What happened to the file? Why?

Override the file, Should have used append or clobbering to avoid this error

	

7. The command "who" shows all connected users along with the connection start date. For example running it on my machine gives:

$ who
ynonperek console  Nov 18 16:29 
ynonperek ttys000  Dec 10 11:58 
ynonperek ttys001  Nov 20 08:35 
ynonperek ttys005  Dec 10 17:04 

I want to show how many connections began in each month so I tried to run the command:
$ who | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c

What was printed? Why? Fix the command line to get the output:
2 Dec
2 Nov

who | tr -s " " | cut -d ' ' -f 3| cut -f2 -d" "| cut -f2 -d-| uniq -c

[Note: Below is the ouput I am getting on my machine,
We can use the tr command to replace for example 05 of May but maybe there is a better why to do it?]  

	2 04
      3 05
      2 06
      1 05
      2 06
