  3. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent paths that were modified today (no matter which day we run the command)
  Answer: 

  ls -alF | grep tocode | grep Jan..2 | wc | cut -d' ' -f7
  
  4. Modify (1) and (2) to count files only (no directories)
  Answer:

  5. The command /sbin/ifconfig shows information regarding the machine's network interfaces. Use the command to print only the IP address of the machine. Remember not to show the special loopback address 127.0.0.1
	
	date:
	ls -alF | grep "$(date '+%b %e')"
	
	ifconfig | grep broadcast | tr -s ' ' | cut -d' ' -f3

  
6. Joe wanted to sort a text file in place so he tried to run the command "sort myfile.txt > myfile.txt". What happened to the file? Why?

	it will overwrite the existing file and it will earsed.
		in order to prevent it the command: set -o noclobber should be used.

7. The command "who" shows all connected users along with the connection start date. For example running it on my machine gives:

$ who
ynonperek console  Nov 18 16:29 
ynonperek ttys000  Dec 10 11:58 
ynonperek ttys001  Nov 20 08:35 
ynonperek ttys005  Dec 10 17:04 

I want to show how many connections began in each month so I tried to run the command:
$ who | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c

What was printed? Why? Fix the command line to get the output:
2 Dec
2 Nov

who | tr -s ' '| cut -d ' ' -f3 | sort | uniq -c
