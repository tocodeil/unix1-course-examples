For each of the following, type a single command line that performs:

  1. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner.
  Answer: ls -l | tail -n +2 | cut -c4 | grep x | wc | cut -c6-7

  2. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent a path that has execute permission to their owner, group and others.
  Answer: ls -l | tail -n +2 | cut -c4,7,10 | grep x | wc | cut -c6-7

  3. Print the number of lines from "ls -l" which represent paths that were modified today (no matter which day we run the command)
  Answer: ls -l |tail -n +2 | grep $(date) | wc | cut -c6-7

  4. Modify (1) and (2) to count files only (no directories)
  Answer:
1: ls -l | tail -n +2 | cut -c1 | grep - | cut -c4 | grep x | wc | cut -c6-7
2: ls -l | tail -n +2 | cut -c1 | grep - | cut -c4,7,10 | grep x | wc | cut -c6-7

5. The command /sbin/ifconfig shows information regarding the machine's network interfaces. Use the command to print only the IP address of the machine. Remember not to show the special loopback address 127.0.0.1
/sbin/ifconfig | grep 'inet ' | head -1
6. Joe wanted to sort a text file in place so he tried to run the command "sort myfile.txt > myfile.txt". What happened to the file? Why?
all the values that were in the file were deleted. Problem is that he tries to run sort on a file and not in the content. Should be something like "cat myfile.txt | sort"
7. The command "who" shows all connected users along with the connection start date. For example running it on my machine gives:

$ who
ynonperek console  Nov 18 16:29 
ynonperek ttys000  Dec 10 11:58 
ynonperek ttys001  Nov 20 08:35 
ynonperek ttys005  Dec 10 17:04 

I want to show how many connections began in each month so I tried to run the command:
$ who | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | sort | uniq -c

What was printed? Why? Fix the command line to get the output:
2 Dec
2 Nov
Only the result of the uniq number from the count operation.
It was because of the parameter "f" that was sent to the sort and uniq
who | cut -d ' ' -f 17 | sort | uniq -c
