1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:

mkdir lab
cd lab/
touch main.c game.c enemy.chero.ca.out
touch monster.h human.h
touch .highscore

2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:

cd lab/
mkdir music misc drivers

3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:

cp /etc/passwd ~/lab/music
cp /etc/passwd ~/lab/misk
cp /etc/passwd ~/lab/drivers

4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.

pico myinfo 
“My name is rachel
Easy to use 
Folders are easily accessible
And that it is free”

Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why?

Because it is impossible to create a file and folder with the same name


 Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ?
 How ?

change the file name "myinfo" to "myinfo.txt
 

5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:

mv *.c ~/lab/music

6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:

mv music drivers

7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? 
Why?
It's not empty
 How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?
rm -r drivers
