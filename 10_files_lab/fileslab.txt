Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. 
Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:


mkdir lab
cd lab/
touch  a.out
touch  hero.c
touch  enemy.c
touch  game.c
touch  main.c
touch  human.h
touch  monster.h
touch  .highscore


2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:



mkdor Musidc Misc Drivers



3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:



cp -r /etc/passwd Drivers/
cp -r /etc/passwd Misc/
cp -r /etc/passwd Music/



4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.


Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? 
How ?

 I cannot create a dir in same location as the file with the same name, because Linux is file descriptive 
I can create in different location a folder and inside of it a file with the same name, or to use capital letters and Linux is case sensitive


5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:



mv main.c game.c enemy.c hero.c Music/


6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:


I used cd ../ to exit Music dir and then:

cp -r Music/ Drivers/



7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?

You can't delete with rmdir directory with files inside, you need to use 
rm -r Drivers/
