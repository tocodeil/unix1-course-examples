  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:
mkdir lab
cd lab
touch a.out
touch hero.c
touch enemy.c
touch game.c
touch main.c
touch human.h
touch monster.h
touch highscore.h

2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

pico myinfo
"Vili Medina" (save)
mv myinfo myinfotxt
mkdir myinfo
cp myinfotxt myinfo
rm -r myinfotxt
