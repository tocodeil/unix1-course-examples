1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:
	sudo mkdir lab
	sudo touch a.out hero.c enemy.c game.c main.c human.h monster.h .highscore
	

2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:
	cd lab
	sudo mkdir Music Misc Drivers

3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:

	sudo cp /etc/passwd /home/lab/Music 
	sudo cp /etc/passwd /homelab/Misc 
	sudo cp /etc/passwd /home/lab/Drivers
	
4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.
	vi myinfo
	mkdir myinfo
	mkdir: cannot create directory ‘myinfo’: File exists
 
Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?
	sudo rm myinfo
	sudo mkdir myinfo
	cd myinfo
	touch myinfo


5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:
	sudo mv main.c game.c enemy.c hero.c /home/lab/Music

6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:
	sudo mv /home/lab/Music /home/lab/Drivers

7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? --> no
	Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ? --> it contain files also, can be deleted by rm -r
