Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore


Write here the commands you used:

nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ cd
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ mkdir lab
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ cd lab
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ >a.out
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ >hero.c
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ >enemy.c
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ >game.c
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ >main.c
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ >human.h
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ >monster.h
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ > .highscore


2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used: 

nadavg@mews2659:~$ cd lab                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ mkdir Music                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ mkdir Misc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ mkdir Drivers

3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:

nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ cp /etc/passwd /homes/nadavg/lab/Music
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ cp /etc/passwd /homes/nadavg/lab/Misc
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ cp /etc/passwd /homes/nadavg/lab/Drivers

4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?

nadavg@mews2659:~$ echo My name is nadav. Linux is fast, comfortable and useful. >> myinfo
nadavg@mews2659:~$ mv myinfo Desktop
nadavg@mews2659:~$ mkdir myinfo
nadavg@mews2659:~$ mv Desktop/myinfo myinfo

It worked because I didn't create the myinfo file on the same directory where myinfo directory was.


5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:

nadavg@mews2659:~$ mv lab/main.c lab/Music/
nadavg@mews2659:~$ mv lab/game.c lab/Music/
nadavg@mews2659:~$ mv lab/enemy.c lab/Music/
nadavg@mews2659:~$ mv lab/hero.c lab/Music/

6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:

nadavg@mews2659:~$ mv lab/Music/ lab/Drivers/

7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?

It failed to remove because the directory is not empty.
Worked with:
nadavg@mews2659:~/lab$ rm -r Drivers
