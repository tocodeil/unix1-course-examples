Files and Directories Lab
Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:
  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore


Write here the commands you used:

in my root folder,
mkdir lab
pico main.c game.c enemy.c hero.c a.out
pico human.h, monster.h
pico .highscore

[Not sure but I went in lab dir and ran the pico command from there, Also I should have used touch and not pico]

2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:
mkdir Music Misc Driversm

3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:

< 681 mews2791 ~/lab> cp /etc/passwd Drivers/
< 682 mews2791 ~/lab> cp /etc/passwd Misc/
< 683 mews2791 ~/lab> cp /etc/passwd Music/

4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?
< 691 mews2791 ~/lab> touch myinfo
< 692 mews2791 ~/lab> pico myinfo
When trying to create a dirctory myinfo I get an message:
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘myinfo’: File exists

I did a bit of reading and a directory is also a file which will explain why I can create both on the same folder. 
I was able to create myinfo folder and witin a myinfo file. 
See below:
< 697 mews2791 ~> cd Downloads/
< 698 mews2791 ~/Downloads> mkdir myinfo
< 699 mews2791 ~/Downloads> cd myinfo/
< 700 mews2791 ~/Downloads/myinfo> touch myinfo


5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:
mv-t Music enemy.c game.c  hero.c  main.c

6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"


Write here the commands you used:
mv Music Drivers/

7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?

When trying to remove:
rmdir: failed to remove ‘Drivers/’: Directory not empty

Should use rm -r to delete a folder with files witin.
