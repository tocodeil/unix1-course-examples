Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used: 
$ mkdir lab
$ cd lab
$ touch a.out hero.c enemy.c game.c main.c human.h monster.h .highscore


2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:
$ mkdir Music Misc Drivers

3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:
$ cp /etc/passwd Music
$ cp /etc/passwd Misc
$ cp /etc/passwd Drivers

4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?

mkdir command failed, since that it is the exact name as the file. However it is possible to create file in with the same name inside a directory (touch <filename>) since there is no ambiguity in the tree.

5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:
$ mv main.c game.c enemy.c hero.c Music

6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:

$ mv Music Drivers

7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?

Failed since the Directory is not empty. Using rm -r will delete Directory recuresively with all its content.
