Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:
mkdir lab
cd lab
touch a.out
touch hero.c
touch enemy.c
touch game.c
touch main.c
touch human.h
touch monster.h
touch .highscore
or combined:
touch a.out a.out a.out game.c main.c human.h human.h



2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:
mkdir Music
mkdir Misc
mkdir Drivers

3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:
from inside the folder
cd Music
cp /etc/passwd .
cd ..
or (from lab folder)
cp /etc/passwd /homs/Moshiko/lab/Misc
cp /etc/passwd /homs/Moshiko/lab/Drivwe


4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

touch myinfo
echo "moshiko">>myinfo
echo "unix is the best because it's free, easy,and fun!">>myinfo
mkdir myinfo ( not working we can't create a directory and file with the same name)


Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?
it's not working we can't create a directory and file with the same name.
we need to:
1-change the location of the folder.
2-change one letter to Capital letter.

5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:
mv main.c /homs/Moshiko/lab/Misc
or combined
mv game.c enamy.c hero.c /homs/Moshiko/lab/Misc

 
6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:
mv Music Drivers 


7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?
rmdir Drivers- not working because it's not an empty folder
we need to use -r whit rm  not rmdir
rm -r Drivers now it's working :)
