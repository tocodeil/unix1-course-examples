Files and Directories Lab
Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:


cd ~
mkdir lab
cd lab

touch a.out
touch hero.c
touch enemy.c
touch game.c
touch main.c


touch human.h
touch monster.h

touch .highscore

2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:

cd ~
cd lab

mkdir Drivers
mkdir Misc
mkdir Music


3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:


cp /etc/passwd /home/leo/lab/Drivers
cp /etc/passwd /home/leo/lab/Music
cp /etc/passwd /home/leo/lab/Misc

4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?

no
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘myinfo’: File exists


i can do a workaround by moving the file to another location, creating the folder, and then moving the file back to the folder:

mv myinfo Music/
leo@leo-VirtualBox:~/lab$ mkdir myinfo
leo@leo-VirtualBox:~/lab/Music$ mv myinfo /home/leo/lab/myinfo/

leo@leo-VirtualBox:~/lab/Music$ cd /home/leo/lab/myinfo/
leo@leo-VirtualBox:~/lab/myinfo$ ll
total 12
-rw-rw-r-- 1 leo leo   26 דצמ 25 10:46 myinfo
leo@leo-VirtualBox:~/lab/myinfo$ 


5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:

leo@leo-VirtualBox:~/lab$ mv *.c /home/leo/lab/Music/


6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:

leo@leo-VirtualBox:~/lab$ mv Music/ Drivers/


7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?

no.

need to use rm -rf
