Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:
cd
mkdir lab
cd lab
pico a.out hero.c enemy.c game.c main.c human.h monster.h .highscore
**Add some words to each file and save it

2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:
I`m already in the folder, so:
mkdir Music Misc Drivers

3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:
cp /etc/passwd /home/ym/lab/Music
cp /etc/passwd /home/ym/lab/Misc
cp /etc/passwd /home/ym/lab/Drivers

4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?
pico myinfo
mkdir myinfo
Cannot create a folder, since there is already a file with the same name
To continue:
mv myinfo myinfo.txt
mkdir myinfo
pico myinfo/myinfo.txt

5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:
mv main.c Music
mv game.c Music
mv enemy.c Music
mv hero.c Music

6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:
mv Music Drivers

7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?
rm Drivers didn`t work, because the folder isn`t empty
Can use: rm -r Drivers
