1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:
>cd
>mkdir lab
>cd lab
>touch a.out hero.c enemy.c game.c main.c human.h monster.h .highscore
>ls -a 
2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:
> mkdir Music Misc Drivers 
> ls 
3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:
> cp /etc/passwd /home/amir/lab/Music
> cp /etc/passwd /home/amir/lab/Misc
> cp /etc/passwd /home/amir/lab/Drivers

4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
> touch myinfo
> vi myinfo
	>"i"
	> new for me to learn
	> free
	> can be confgured according to one's needs
	>"esc" ":wq!"
> cat myinfo
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? no
Why? the directiry has already a file with the same name
Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" - yes
How ?
u need to create this directory in alter location
copy the file into it
copy entire directory to the needed location

> cd /home/amir/
> mkdir myinfo
> cp /home/amir/lab/myinfo /home/amir/myinfo/
> rm /home/amir/lab/myinfo
> mv /home/amir/myinfo /home/amir/lab/
