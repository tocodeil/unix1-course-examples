Files and Directories Lab
Online: https://www.tocode.co.il/bundles/unix1/lessons/fileslab

1. Create a new folder named "lab" in your home directory and inside create the files:

  - a.out, hero.c, enemy.c, game.c, main.c
  - human.h, monster.h
  - .highscore

Write here the commands you used:

$ mkdir ~/lab
$ touch ~/lab/a.out

Better to 'cd' into lab in order to create multiple files at once.

$ cd lab
$ touch hero.c enemy.c game.c main.c
$ touch human.c monster.
$ touch .highscore


2. "cd" into lab folder and inside create the following subdirectories:
  - Music
  - Misc
  - Drivers

Write here the commands you used:

$ mkdir Music Misc Drivers


3. Copy the file "/etc/passwd" to each subdirectory created in (2).

Write here the commands you used:
$ pwd
/home/yosef/lab
$ cp /etc/passwd Dr*
$ cp /etc/passwd Mi*
$ cp /etc/passwd Mu*

I tried to "cp" all of them all together (cp /etc/passwd Mi* Mu* Dr*), but cp can copy multiple sourses to DIR, but not to multiple DIRS (According to cp --help it can: "Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY")


4. Create a file named myinfo and inside write your name and 3 things you like about Unix.
Now create a new directory named "myinfo" and move the file into it.

Did it work? Why? Can you create a file "myinfo" inside a directory named "myinfo" ? How ?

$ touch myinfo
$ pico my* ; Ctrl+x
$ mkdir myinfo

It did not work, got this:
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘myinfo’: File exists
I guess: in the same directory two files with same names can not be created.

$ rm myinfo
$ mkdir 
$ touch ~/myinfo/myinfo

Now two files of the same name are in the different places, so they are not equal (location differs), so there is no problem of two same objects.



5. Move the files "main.c", "game.c", "enemy.c" and "hero.c" to folder "Music".

Write here the commands you used:

$ mv ~/lab/????.c ?????.c ~/lab/Music

6. Move the folder "Music" with all its contents into directory "Drivers"

Write here the commands you used:

$ mv ~/lab/Mu* ~/lab/Dr*

7. Try to use "rmdir" to delete directory "Drivers". Did it work? Why? How can you delete directory "Drivers" ?

It did not work, for rmdir works for empty folders only.

rm -r ~/lab/Dr*

*I have a silly question: can directory be changed somehow to become a file?
