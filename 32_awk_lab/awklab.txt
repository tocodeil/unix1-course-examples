1. Write an awk one-liner that prints the file "shells" with a blank line after each line

Answer:


cat /etc/shells |awk 'BEGIN{ORS="n\n"};1'



2. Write an awk one-liner that prints the file "shells" with a ">" sign at the beginning of each line

Answer: 

cat /etc/shells |awk '{sub(/^/, ">")};1'


3. Write an awk one-liner to swap the first and last words in the output of "help cd"

help cd |awk '{tmp=$1;$1=$NF;$NF=tmp;print}'


4. The command /sbin/ifconfig prints information about network interfaces on the machine. 
A sample output is provided in the file "ifconfig.sample", 
and looks like this:

en3: flags=8963 mtu 1500
    options=60
    
ether 32:00:18:24:c0:00
    media: autoselect 
    
status: inactive
p2p0: flags=8843 mtu 2304
    
ether 06:38:35:47:96:24
    media: autoselect
   
 status: inactive


Write an awk one liner that splits this file into multiple file, one for each block, 
so after running the script we'll have a file named "en3" with the lines of the first block, 
and another file named "p2p0" with the lines of the second block.




I don't have such file, can I use something else similar (can you tell me which?)?
