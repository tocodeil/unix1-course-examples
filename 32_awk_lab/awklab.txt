2. Write an awk one-liner that prints the file "shells" with a ">" sign at the beginning of each line

3. Write an awk one-liner to swap the first and last words in the output of "help cd"

4. The command /sbin/ifconfig prints information about network interfaces on the machine. A sample output is provided in the file "ifconfig.sample", and looks like this:

en3: flags=8963 mtu 1500
    options=60
    ether 32:00:18:24:c0:00
    media: autoselect 
    status: inactive
p2p0: flags=8843 mtu 2304
    ether 06:38:35:47:96:24
    media: autoselect
    status: inactive

Write an awk one liner that splits this file into multiple file, one for each block, so after running the script we'll have a file named "en3" with the lines of the first block, and another file named "p2p0" with the lines of the second block.
Answer: /sbin/ifconfig | awk ' BEGIN { block=1 } { if(length($0) > 0) print $0 > block } { if(length($0) == 0) block++ } '
