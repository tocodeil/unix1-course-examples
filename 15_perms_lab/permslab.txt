1. Using the file structure in the current directory, write the commands that perform the following:

  - change permission of file src/main.c to r--r--r-- using chmod letter notation
	chmod a=r src/main.c

  - change permission of file include/player.h to r-xrw--r- using chmod octal (numbers) notation
  chmod 564 include/player.h

  - change permission of all files in Doc folder (without changing the permissions of Doc folder itself) to rw-------
  chmod 600 Doc/*

  - change permission of "lib" folder and all files and subdirectories inside it to rwxrwxrwx
  chmod -R 777 lib

2. create a new directory named "test" and inside an empty file named "secret". Change permissions of the file "secret" to ---------. Can you delete the file secret? can you delete the folder test? why?
I was able to delete the file and directory cause I was the owner.

3. Read the output of "help umask". Explain in your own words what umask does, and how would you use it to set new files permissions to ------r--
The umask command is used to set new files' default permissions masks (the mask is the complimentary bitwise number to the required permission).
umask -S 773
