1. Using the file structure in the current directory, write the commands that perform the following:

  - change permission of file src/main.c to r--r--r-- using chmod letter notation

  - change permission of file include/player.h to r-xrw--r- using chmod octal (numbers) notation

  - change permission of all files in Doc folder (without changing the permissions of Doc folder itself) to rw-------

  - change permission of "lib" folder and all files and subdirectories inside it to rwxrwxrwx

2. create a new directory named "test" and inside an empty file named "secret". Change permissions of the file "secret" to ---------. Can you delete the file secret? can you delete the folder test? why?

3. Read the output of "help umask". Explain in your own words what umask does, and how would you use it to set new files permissions to ------r--



1. cd wildcards
2. chmod a=r main.c
3. chmod 562 player.h
4. Not sure what happend, but using the following chmod, it "kicked" me out from "Doc" dir.
How can I revers it?
5. chmod -R 600 README.txt text.c
6. chmod -R 777 lib zlib.c
7. mkdir test, cd test, touch secret
chmod 000 secret
remove write-protected regular empty file �secret�? yes
yes rm -r test

8.  umask 773
just to check if it worked, i created a new file "umsk"
