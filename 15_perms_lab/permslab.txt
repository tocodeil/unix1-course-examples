1. Using the file structure in the current directory, write the commands that perform the following:

  - change permission of file src/main.c to r--r--r-- using chmod letter notation

chmod u=r,g=r,o=r /home/yosef/wilcards/src/main.c

  - change permission of file include/player.h to r-xrw--r- using chmod octal (numbers) notation

chmod 564 /home/yosef/wilcards/include/player.h

  - change permission of all files in Doc folder (without changing the permissions of Doc folder itself) to rw-------

chmod 600 /home/yosef/wilcards/Doc/*

  - change permission of "lib" folder and all files and subdirectories inside it to rwxrwxrwx

chmod -R 777  /home/yosef/wilcards/lib

2. create a new directory named "test" and inside an empty file named "secret". Change permissions of the file "secret" to ---------. Can you delete the file secret? can you delete the folder test? why?

mkdir test
touch ~/test/secret
chmod 000 ~/test/secret
rm ~/test/secret
rm -r test
It's possible, for deleting file = editing this file, so if you can set permissions, which is editing, so you also can delete the file  and  directory = file, so the same.

3. Read the output of "help umask". Explain in your own words what umask does, and how would you use it to set new files permissions to ------r--

Sets new files' permissions or shows you their current value.
umask 773
