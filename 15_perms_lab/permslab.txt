1. Using the file structure in the current directory, write the commands that perform the following:

  - change permission of file src/main.c to r--r--r-- using chmod letter notation
chmod 444 src/main.c


  - change permission of file include/player.h to r-xrw--r- using chmod octal (numbers) notation

chmod 564 include/player.h
[note: for the group ALL should be the order in r-- ? Like rwx?]

  - change permission of all files in Doc folder (without changing the permissions of Doc folder itself) to rw-------

[q: is it possible to undo? Sadly I made a mistake an changed also permissions of Doc folder itself]

chmod 600 Doc/*.* 
[I changed again the permisson and after running the above command I see that the permisson only the file now is as requsted, My reasoning was that only if it's a file we need to change and this is why I used *.*]. 


  - change permission of "lib" folder and all files and subdirectories inside it to rwxrwxrwx

chmod 777 lib/*


2. create a new directory named "test" and inside an empty file named "secret". Change permissions of the file "secret" to ---------. Can you delete the file secret? can you delete the folder test? Why?

When trying to rm the file I see this output:
rm: remove write-protected regular empty file ‘test/secret’?

I was able to remove the file but was asked if I want to.

When trying to delete the folder I see the same output as above, 
[I have created again the file secret with chmod 000]

I assume that the reason it that the permission set is for non so I see this output.

3. Read the output of "help umask". Explain in your own words what umask does, and how would you use it to set new files permissions to ------r--

Control over defult setup for permissions, 

defult for new file is 666 

and we want only 004 

umask 662
