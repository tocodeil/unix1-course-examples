Preparation: Perform the following  (no need to write the commands you used):

  - create a new directory named "links"
  - cd to it
  - inside the directory create 2 text files named "file1" and "file2". Write the names of some things you like in file "file1", and some things you don't like in file "file2"

1. Perform the following and write the commands you used, from within links directory:

  - Create a symbolic link named file3 that points to "file1"
  Answer: ln -s $(realpath file1) file3

  - Create a hard link named file4 that points to "file2"
  Answer: ln file2 file4

  - Create a new directory named "tmp" in your home folder:
  Answer:
  mkdir ../tmp

2. Move "file3" to the new "~/tmp" directory you just created. Can you still use it to see the original "file1" ? Why not? How would you create a symbolic link that would survive the transfer to ~/tmp ?
I've created symbolic link with absolute path, therefore I can see the original "file1"

3. How can you tell that "file2" and "file4" refer to the same file?
By executing the command: ls -li --> I can see that both have the same ID.
