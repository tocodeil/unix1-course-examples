Preparation: Perform the following  (no need to write the commands you used):

 
 - create a new directory named "links"
  - cd to it
  

mkdir links
ln -s links  roi

- inside the directory create 2 text files named "file1" and "file2". Write the names of some things you like in file "file1", and some things you don't like in file "file2"



cd links
pico file1
pico file2

1. Perform the following and write the commands you used, from within links directory:

  

- Create a symbolic link named file3 that points to "file1"
 
Answer: 

 ln -s file 1 file 3

 - Create a hard link named file4 that points to "file2"

  Answer: ln "file2" "file4"

 

  - Create a new directory named "tmp" in your home folder:
 
 Answer:

 


2. Move "file3" to the new "~/tmp" directory you just created. Can you still use it to see the original "file1" ? Why not? How would you create a symbolic link that would survive the transfer to ~/tmp ?


mv links/file3 ~/tmp
cd ~/tmp
ls -l file3
file3 ---> file1
ls ../file3

no such file or directory. 

ln-s /home/rpi/tmp/file3  link-to-main
ls -l link-to-main
link-to-main ---> /home/roi/tmp/file3



3. How can you tell that "file2" and "file4" refer to the same file?
