Preparation: Perform the following  (no need to write the commands you used):

  - create a new directory named "links"
  - cd to it
  - inside the directory create 2 text files named "file1" and "file2". Write the names of some things you like in file "file1", and some things you don't like in file "file2"

1. Perform the following and write the commands you used, from within links directory:

  - Create a symbolic link named file3 that points to "file1"
  Answer: 
	ln -s file1 file3

  - Create a hard link named file4 that points to "file2"
  Answer: 
	ln file2 file4

  - Create a new directory named "tmp" in your home folder:
  Answer:
	benjaminm@mews2791:~/lab/links$ mkdir tmp
	benjaminm@mews2791:~/lab/links$ mv tmp ~
	[q:I think there is a way to do it in one line of command?]

2. Move "file3" to the new "~/tmp" directory you just created. Can you still use it to see the original "file1" ? Why not? How would you create a symbolic link that would survive the transfer to ~/tmp ?

No, it was relative to the links folder, once we changed the location it can't find the location for file1, 
I will use the realpath and so when moving the file we will still get the link to file1. 

3. How can you tell that "file2" and "file4" refer to the same file?

ls -il,
Same  inode number.
