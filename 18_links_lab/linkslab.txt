Preparation: Perform the following  (no need to write the commands you used):

 
 - create a new directory named "links"
  - cd to it
  - inside the directory create 2 text files named "file1" and "file2". 
Write the names of some things you like in file "file1", and some things you don't like in file "file2"


1. Perform the following and write the commands you used, from within links directory:

  
- Create a symbolic link named file3 that points to "file1"
  Answer: 



ln -s file1 file3

- Create a hard link named file4 that points to "file2"
  Answer: 

 
 
ln file2 file4 

- Create a new directory named "tmp" in your home folder:
  Answer:


cd
mkdir tmp


2. Move "file3" to the new "~/tmp" directory you just created. Can you still use it to see the original "file1" ? 
Why not? 

No, because I moved the link to another place and broke it 


How would you create a symbolic link that would survive the transfer to ~/tmp ?

I need to create it using full path 

ln -s $(realpath file1) file3 
mv file3 ~/tmp/
cd ../tmp/
ls

and it's a workable link 


3. How can you tell that "file2" and "file4" refer to the same file?


ls -li

they both have the same number
