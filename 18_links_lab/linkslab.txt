Preparation: Perform the following  (no need to write the commands you used):

  - create a new directory named "links"
  - cd to it
  - inside the directory create 2 text files named "file1" and "file2". 
Write the names of some things you like in file "file1", and some things you don't like in file "file2"


1. Perform the following and write the commands you used, from within links directory:

  - Create a symbolic link named file3 that points to "file1"
  
Answer: 

 ln -s file1 file3
- Create a hard link named file4 that points to "file2"
  
Answer: 

  ln file2 file4
- Create a new directory named "tmp" in your home folder:
  
Answer:

   mkdir /home/avia/tmp

2. Move "file3" to the new "~/tmp" directory you just created. Answer: mv home/avia/lab4/links/file3 /home/avia/tmp
Can you still use it to see the original "file1" ? No. Why not? Because when moving synbolic link to different directory - the link will not work for the original file anymore.
How would you create a symbolic link that would survive the transfer to ~/tmp ?

ln -s /home/avia/lab4/links/file1 /home/avia/tmp/file4

3. How can you tell that "file2" and "file4" refer to the same file? ls -l gives us output for the files that exist in the folder, which we can see that file 2 and file 4 have the same date+permissions+ 2 = numbers of names to the same file
