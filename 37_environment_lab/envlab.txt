1. Write the following aliases into the file aliases (and upload that file too):
  - ll => ls -l
  - rm => rm -i
  - cp => cp -i
  
  
    alias 	ll ="ls -l"
	alias	rm ="rm -i"
	alias	cp ="cp -i"

2. How can you "install" all defined aliases into the current shell? How can you add them permenantly to all shells?
	current shell - just create alias
	To create an alias permanently add the alias to your .bashrc file
	bash_aliases

3. Add the following aliases into the aliases file you defined previously:
  - count_files => print the number of files in current directory
	alias count_files=:ls |wc -l"
  - bysize => print files ordered by size
	alias bysize="ls -S"
  - ff => search a file by partial name. For example running "ff ba" should print all files with "ba" in their name
	alias ff="find . -name '*ba&'"
  - lsf => like "ls -l" but print only files
	alias	lsf="ls -p |grep -v /"
  - lsd => like "ls -l" but print only directories
	alias lsd="ls -d */"
  - lsg => like "ls -l" but print all directories first and then files
	alias lsg="ls -la | sort -k 1"
