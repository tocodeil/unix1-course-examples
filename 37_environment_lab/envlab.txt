1. Write the following aliases into the file aliases (and upload that file too):
  - ll => ls -l
  - rm => rm -i
  - cp => cp -i



alias ll= "ls -l"
alias rm= "rm -i"
alias cp ="cp -i"

2. How can you "install" all defined aliases into the current shell? How can you add them permenantly to all shells?


this is what i did and i didn't gey any error:
cp b.txt /home/roi/wildcards


3. Add the following aliases into the aliases file you defined previously:
  - count_files => print the number of files in current directory
  - bysize => print files ordered by size
  - ff => search a file by partial name. For example running "ff ba" should print all files with "ba" in their name
  - lsf => like "ls -l" but print only files
  - lsd => like "ls -l" but print only directories
  - lsg => like "ls -l" but print all directories first and then files
