1. Write the following aliases into the file aliases (and upload that file too):

gedit someAlias.bash
bash someAlias.bash

 the file
#!/bin/bash
alias ll='ls -l' 
alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'


___________
 #I tried also to make vt5his file be opened with bash automaticaly:
echo $SHELL
/bin/bash

#then I wrote in shell

 ./someAlias.bash
#but I got
bash: ./someAlias.bash: Permission denied
 
WHY? bash someAlias.bash works and this not?

2. How can you "install" all defined aliases into the current shell? How can you add them permenantly to all shells?

gedit .bashrc
# some more ls aliases
alias ll='ls -l' 
alias rm='rm -i'
alias cp='cp -i'
#then to write in shell
source ~/.bashrc

3. Add the following aliases into the aliases file you defined previously:
  - count_files => print the number of files in current directory
alias count_files='find .//. ! -name . -print | grep -c //'
  - bysize => print files ordered by size
alias bysize='ls -lS | grep '^-' '
  - ff => search a file by partial name. For example running "ff ba" should print all files with "ba" in their name
It should be a function, for only function can take user_input&regex together
ff() { find . -iname "*$1*" -ls; }
  - lsf => like "ls -l" but print only files
alias lsf=' ls -l | grep '^-' '
  - lsd => like "ls -l" but print only directories
alias lsd=' ls -l | grep '^d' '
  - lsg => like "ls -l" but print all directories first and then files
alias lsg='ls -la | grep "^d" && ls -la | grep "^-"'
