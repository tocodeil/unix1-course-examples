1. Write the following aliases into the file aliases (and upload that file too):

  - ll => ls -l

  - rm => rm -i

  - cp => cp -i
    
    alisa ll="ls -l"
    alias rm="rm -i"
    alais cp="cp -i"
    echo �a ll 'ls -l'�>> file name ?

2. How can you "install" all defined aliases into the current shell? How can you add them permenantly to all shells?

  we need to check the filr bachrc
  we need to add the aliases to bach_aliases 

3. Add the following aliases into the aliases file you defined previously:

  - count_files => print the number of files in current directory
        alisa count_files="ls -d | wc -l" 

  - bysize => print files ordered by size
         alisa bysize= "ls -S" 

  - ff => search a file by partial name. For example running "ff ba" should print all files with "ba" in their name
        alisa ff = "ls -l | find . type f $1,$2

  - lsf => like "ls -l" but print only files
    alisa lsf ="ls -f"

  - lsd => like "ls -l" but print only directories
   alisa lsd="ls -d"

  - lsg => like "ls -l" but print all directories first and then files
   alisa lsg="ls -d | ls -f"
