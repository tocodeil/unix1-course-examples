1. Write the following aliases into the file aliases (and upload that file too):
  - ll => ls -l
  - rm => rm -i
  - cp => cp -i

2. How can you "install" all defined aliases into the current shell? How can you add them permenantly to all shells?

3. Add the following aliases into the aliases file you defined previously:
  - count_files => print the number of files in current directory
  - bysize => print files ordered by size
  - ff => search a file by partial name. For example running "ff ba" should print all files with "ba" in their name
  - lsf => like "ls -l" but print only files
  - lsd => like "ls -l" but print only directories
  - lsg => like "ls -l" but print all directories first and then files
