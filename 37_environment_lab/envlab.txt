1. Write the following aliases into the file aliases (and upload that file too):
  - ll => ls -l
  - rm => rm -i
  - cp => cp -i
ll="ls -i"
rm="rm -i"
cp="cp -i"
  
2. How can you "install" all defined aliases into the current shell? How can you add them permenantly to all shells?
In the current shell: just add alias as needed, such as: alias ll="ls -a". 
Also can use a bash file to add several aliases and then run the file

For all shells, there is a need to edit the file .bashrc that is under the home directory

3. Add the following aliases into the aliases file you defined previously:
  - count_files => print the number of files in current directory
  alias count_files="ls -1 | wc -l"
  - bysize => print files ordered by size
  alias bysize="ls -lS"
  - ff => search a file by partial name. For example running "ff ba" should print all files with "ba" in their name
  alias ff="find . -name '*$1*'"
  - lsf => like "ls -l" but print only files
  alias lsf="ls -d ./*/"
  - lsd => like "ls -l" but print only directories
  alias lsd="ls -p | grep -v /"
  - lsg => like "ls -l" but print all directories first and then files
  alias lsg="ls -la | sort -r"
