1. Write command lines to find using "find":


  -. All files owned by yourself in /tmp folder

  

~/tmp find.

-. All files and directories not owned by you in /tmp folder

 

$ find . ! -user roi

 -. All files, folders and links in your home folder whose name ends with a ".c"


cd ~ find . -name '*.c'


  -. All files in your home folder whose name starts with an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"

  

find . -name "*[aeiou]"

-. All files in your home directory whose size is above 10MB

  

find . -size +10M

-. All files in your home directory which were modified in the past 2 days



find/home/roi -mtime -2



  -. All files in your home directory which were not modified for over a month, and size is above 10MB.

find . -mtime +30 -size +10M




2. Create a hard link to a file of your choice and put it in a subdirectory under your home folder. How can you use "find" to locate the hard link given the original file?


ln "music" "link-to-music"
ls -l "music"
mkdir secret
mv music /home/secret ---> premission denied 


3. Create 3 empty text files a.txt, b.txt and c.txt. Use a single find command to:
  - copy a.txt to a.txt.backup
  - copy b.txt to b.txt.backup
  - copy c.txt to c.txt.backup
What was the command?  


find . -name '*.txt' -exec cp {} "{}" .bak \i
