1. Write command lines to find using "find":

  -. All files owned by yourself in /tmp folder
		find /tmp -user caspib

  -. All files and directories not owned by you in /tmp folder
		find /tmp -not -user caspib
		
  -. All files, folders and links in your home folder whose name ends with a ".c"
		find ~ -L -name '*.c'

  -. All files in your home folder whose name starts with an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
		find ~ -type f -name '*[aeiou]
		
  -. All files in your home directory whose size is above 10MB
		find ~ -size +100M
		
  -. All files in your home directory which were modified in the past 2 days
		find ~ -mtime -2
		
  -. All files in your home directory which were not modified for over a month, and size is above 10MB.
		find ~ -mtime +30 -size +100MB
		
	2. Create a hard link to a file of your choice and put it in a subdirectory under your home folder. How can you use "find" to locate the hard link given the original file?
	
		find . -samefile /path/to/file
		find . -inum NUM
		
3. Create 3 empty text files a.txt, b.txt and c.txt. Use a single find command to:
  - copy a.txt to a.txt.backup
  - copy b.txt to b.txt.backup
  - copy c.txt to c.txt.backup
What was the command?  
	find ~ -type f -name "*.txt" -exec cp {} "{}".backup \;
