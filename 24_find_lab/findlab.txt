1. Write command lines to find using "find":

  -. All files owned by yourself in /tmp folder
With ls -l to show permissions as well...

find ~/tmp -type f -user $USER -exec ls -l {} \;

  -. All files and directories not owned by you in /tmp folder

find ~/tmp ! -user $USER -exec ls -l {} \;


  -. All files, folders and links in your home folder whose name ends with a ".c"

find . -type f -name '*.c'

  -. All files in your home folder whose name starts with an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"

find ~/ -type f-name '[aeiou]*'

  -. All files in your home directory whose size is above 10MB

find ~/ -type f -size +10M

  -. All files in your home directory which were modified in the past 2 days

find ~/ -type f -mtime -2 -exec ls -l {} \;

  -. All files in your home directory which were not modified for over a month, and size is above 10MB.

find ~/ -mtime +30 -size +10M

2. Create a hard link to a file of your choice and put it in a subdirectory under your home folder. How can you use "find" to locate the hard link given the original file?

ln $(realpath myfile.txt) ~/lab/linkMyfile
find ~/ -type f -samefile ~/myfile.txt

3. Create 3 empty text files a.txt, b.txt and c.txt. Use a single find command to:
  - copy a.txt to a.txt.backup
  - copy b.txt to b.txt.backup
  - copy c.txt to c.txt.backup
What was the command?  
find -name '[a-c].txt' -exec cp {}  {}.backupm \;
