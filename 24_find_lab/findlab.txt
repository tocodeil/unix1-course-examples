1. Write command lines to find using "find":

  -. All files owned by yourself in /tmp folder
     find ~/tmp \!-user moshiko

     find /tmp -user moshiko
     find -user $USER -type f
     find ~/tmp -type f �user moshiko
     I am not sure what is the best answer
  -. All files and directories not owned by you in /tmp folder
 
     find . \! -user $USER \( -type d -or -type f \)
      
     
  -. All files, folders and links in your home folder whose name ends with a ".c"

    find ~ -type d -or -type f -or -type l -name "*.c"
   

  -. All files in your home folder whose name starts with an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"

     find ~ -name "a*" -or -name "e*" -or -name "i*" -or -name "o*" -or -name "u*"

  -. All files in your home directory whose size is above 10MB

     find . -size +10M

  -. All files in your home directory which were modified in the past 2 days
  
     find ~ -type f -a -mtime -2

  -. All files in your home directory which were not modified for over a month, and size is above 10MB.

    find ~ -size +10M -a -mtime +30


2. Create a hard link to a file of your choice and put it in a subdirectory under your home folder. How can you use "find" to locate the hard link given the original file?



3. Create 3 empty text files a.txt, b.txt and c.txt. Use a single find command to:

  - copy a.txt to a.txt.backup

  - copy b.txt to b.txt.backup

  - copy c.txt to c.txt.backup

What was the command?
