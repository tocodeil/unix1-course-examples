1. Write command lines to find using "find":

  -. All files owned by yourself in /tmp folder
find ./tmp -user ym
  -. All files and directories not owned by you in /tmp folder
find ./tmp ! -user ym
  -. All files, folders and links in your home folder whose name ends with a ".c"
find . -name "*.c"
  -. All files in your home folder whose name starts with an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
find . -name "a*.*" -o -name "e*.*" -o -name "i*.*" -o -name "o*.*" -o -name "u*.*"
  -. All files in your home directory whose size is above 10MB
find . -size +10M
  -. All files in your home directory which were modified in the past 2 days
find . -mtime 2
  -. All files in your home directory which were not modified for over a month, and size is above 10MB.
find . ! mtime 1 -sizw +10M
2. Create a hard link to a file of your choice and put it in a subdirectory under your home folder. How can you use "find" to locate the hard link given the original file?
ln 1.txt /tmp5.txt
find . -type f -samefile "1.txt"
3. Create 3 empty text files a.txt, b.txt and c.txt. Use a single find command to:
  - copy a.txt to a.txt.backup
  - copy b.txt to b.txt.backup
  - copy c.txt to c.txt.backup
What was the command?  
find . -type f -name "?.txt" -exec cp {} "{}".backup \;
