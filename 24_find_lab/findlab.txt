1. Write command lines to find using "find":

  
-. All files owned by yourself in /tmp folder

  
I typed find /tmp/ -user yulia and mostly receive permission messages


-. All files and directories not owned by you in /tmp folder

 

I typed find /tmp/ -user root and mostly receive permission messages, same as with find /tmp/ -group root 


-. All files, folders and links in your home folder whose name ends with a ".c"

  

find . -name "*.c"


-. All files in your home folder whose name starts with an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"

  
find ~ -type f -name "[aeiou]*"


-. All files in your home directory whose size is above 10MB

  
find ~ -type f -size +10M

-. All files in your home directory which were modified in the past 2 days

  

find ~ -type f -mtime -1

-. All files in your home directory which were not modified for over a month, and size is above 10MB.


find ~ -type f -mtime +30 -size +10M



2. Create a hard link to a file of your choice and put it in a subdirectory under your home folder. 


How can you use "find" to locate the hard link given the original file?


find . -type f -samefile link


3. Create 3 empty text files a.txt, b.txt and c.txt. 
Use a single find command to:
 
- copy a.txt to a.txt.backup
  
- copy b.txt to b.txt.backup
  
- copy c.txt to c.txt.backup


What was the command?  



find . -name "*.txt" -exec cp {} "{}".backup \;
