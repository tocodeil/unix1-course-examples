Only folders (without subs)

1. Type in a glob pattern to match:

  1. All files whose name starts with a lowercase letter
  Answer: 

export LC_COLLATE=C
ls -d [a-z]*

  2. All files whose name starts with an uppercase letter
  Answer:

ls -d [A-Z]*


  3. All files whose name ends in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:

ls -d *[aeiou]


  4. All files whose name DOES NOT end in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:

ls -d *[!aeiou]

  5. All files with extension ".c" that are in a folder named "src"
  Answer:
cd sr
l *.c


  6. All files with extension ".c" under any folder
  Answer:

find -name '*.c'

2. Write a command that would delete all files ending with a ".png" under any subdirectory.

find -name '*.png' -exec rm *.png {} \

3. The command "ls -l" can take the name of a file or directory and show details on them. From within "wildcards" folder run "ls -l [A-Z]*". What was printed? Why?

Content of "Doc" (first directory). Because after ls -l path to certain folder must be typed. So "[A-Z]*" bash takes as "every subfolder which starts from capital letter".

4. Search in "man ls" for an option to show only directory data so the command "ls _____ D*" should print only the word Doc
ls -d D*
