1. Type in a glob pattern to match:

  1. All files whose name starts with a lowercase letter
  Answer: 
nadavg@mews2659:~/wildcards$ ls -d [a-z]*

  2. All files whose name starts with an uppercase letter
  Answer:
nadavg@mews2659:~/wildcards$ ls -d [A-Z]*

  3. All files whose name ends in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:
nadavg@mews2659:~/wildcards$ ls -d *[aeiou]

  4. All files whose name DOES NOT end in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:
nadavg@mews2659:~/wildcards$ ls -d *[!aeiou]

  5. All files with extension ".c" that are in a folder named "src"
  Answer:
mews2659 ~ >> ls /homes/nadavg/wildcards/src/*.c

  6. All files with extension ".c" under any folder
  Answer:
mews2659 ~/wildcards >> ls */*.c

2. Write a command that would delete all files ending with a ".png" under any subdirectory.
mews2659 ~/wildcards >> rm */*.png

3. The command "ls -l" can take the name of a file or directory and show details on them. From within "wildcards" folder run "ls -l [A-Z]*". What was printed? Why?

mews2659 ~/wildcards >> ls -l [A-Z]*
total 0
-rw-r--r-- 1 nadavg develop6 0 May 29 16:53 README.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 nadavg develop6 0 May 29 16:53 test.c

README.txt was printed because it starts with a capital letter, but I'm not sure why test.c was printed..

4. Search in "man ls" for an option to show only directory data so the command "ls _____ D*" should print only the word Doc

mews2659 ~/wildcards >> ls -d D*
