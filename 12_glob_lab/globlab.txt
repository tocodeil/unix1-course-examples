1. Type in a glob pattern to match:

  1. All files whose name starts with a lowercase letter
  Answer: [a-z]*

  Ofir>> for some reason the shell is not case sensitive so also upper case letters are matched, same for the next quesiton. 
  
  2. All files whose name starts with an uppercase letter
  Answer: [A-Z]*

  3. All files whose name ends in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer: *[aeiou].*

  4. All files whose name DOES NOT end in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer: *[!aeiou].*

  5. All files with extension ".c" that are in a folder named "src"
  Answer: ls src/*.c

  6. All files with extension ".c" under any folder
  Answer: ls */*.c

2. Write a command that would delete all files ending with a ".png" under any subdirectory.
$ rm */*.png

3. The command "ls -l" can take the name of a file or directory and show details on them. From within "wildcards" folder run "ls -l [A-Z]*". What was printed? Why?
Suppose to print the content of Doc directory. as the match should start with upper case letter. Like I mentioned above, for some reason the match is not case sensitive.

4. Search in "man ls" for an option to show only directory data so the command "ls _____ D*" should print only the word Doc

$ ls -l -d [D]*
