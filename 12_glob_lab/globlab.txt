1. 

Type in a glob pattern to match:

 
 1. All files whose name starts with a lowercase letter
  Answer: 

 
ls -d [[:lower:]]*/*
 2. All files whose name starts with an uppercase letter
  Answer:

 
ls -d [[:upper:]]*/* - for some reason shows the following:
Doc/README.txt Doc/test.c
Why test.c as well?

 3. All files whose name ends in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:

 
echo *[a,e,i,o,u]

 4. All files whose name DOES NOT end in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:

 
echo *[!aeiou]

 5. All files with extension ".c" that are in a folder named "src"
  Answer:



ls *.c src/
  
6. All files with extension ".c" under any folder
  Answer:


find -name '*.c'

     2. Write a command that would delete all files ending with a ".png" under any subdirectory
find -name '*.png* -delete

     

3. The command "ls -l" can take the name of a file or directory and show details on them. From within "wildcards" folder run "ls -l [A-Z]*". What was printed? Why?
Printed same thing as in answer to question 2, I don't understand why only these files are printed 

     

4. Search in "man ls" for an option to show only directory data so the command "ls _____ D*" should print only the word Doc

ls -d D*
