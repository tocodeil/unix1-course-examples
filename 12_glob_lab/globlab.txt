1. Type in a glob pattern to match:

  1. All files whose name starts with a lowercase letter
  Answer: 
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ ls -d [[:lower:]]*
img  include  lib  src

  2. All files whose name starts with an uppercase letter
  Answer:
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ ls -d [[:upper:]]*
Doc

  3. All files whose name ends in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ ls -d *[aeiou]
include

  4. All files whose name DOES NOT end in an "a", "e", "i", "o" or "u"
  Answer:
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ ls  *[!aeiou] -d
Doc  img  lib  src

5. All files with extension ".c" that are in a folder named "src"
  Answer:
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards/src$ ls -d *[.c]
main.c  playaer.c

6. All files with extension ".c" under any folder
  Answer:
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ ls * | grep "\.c$"
test.c
zlib.c
main.c
playaer.c

2. Write a command that would delete all files ending with a ".png" under any subdirectory.
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ find . -type f -name '*.png'
./img/player.png
./img/hero.png
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ find . -type f -name '*.png' -delete


3. The command "ls -l" can take the name of a file or directory and show details on them. 
From within "wildcards" folder run "ls -l [A-Z]*". What was printed? Why?

All the folders and fiels inside them, becays of the A-Z* matching.

4. Search in "man ls" for an option to show only directory data so the command "ls _____ D*" 
should print only the word Doc
maxim@maxim-virtual-machine:~/wildcards$ ls  -d D*
Doc
