Intro To Command Line Lab.

1. Login to your UNIX account. How do you find:

  - your current shell?  $ echo $0

  - your default shell?  $ echo $SHELL

  - a list of all shells currently installed on the machine?  $ cat /etc/shells



2. View the file /etc/passwd on your machine with the command "cat /etc/passwd". Then read about the file in "man 5 passwd". a. What information is held in the file? b. What are the fields in each line?

a. In short: info about /etc/passwd.

DESCRIPTION 
/etc/passwd contains one line for each user account, with seven fields delimited by colons (":").

*By the way, if the last field id "optional user command interpreter", what does it mean "nologin". Is "nologin" also interpreter, like bash?

b. These fields are:

       o   login name

       o   optional encrypted password

       o   numerical user ID

       o   numerical group ID

       o   user name or comment field

       o   user home directory

       o   optional user command interpreter


3. In Unix, the /etc folder holds configuration files. Display all files in "/etc" folder ordered by file size (Hint: search in "man ls") $ ls -S /etc

$ ls -s -S /etc - this is better, for it also shows the actual size

4. Print current date/time formatted as: "Sun 21/03/2010, 14:30". Hint: read "man date" and search for the correct format string. 

$ export LC_ALL=C
date '+%a %d/%m/%Y, %H:%M'

 By the way in synopsis, it was no info about need of "" and + to write before option... I mean $ date -u %c didn't work.

SYNOPSIS
       date [-u|--utc|--universal] [MMDDhhmm[[CC]YY][.ss]]
