Use grep to print only the lines from "input" for which:

1. There is a binary number in the line
	cat input |grep -a [0-9]

2. There is an even binary number in the line
	cat input |grep -a *[0-9]
3. Line includes a hexadecimal number
	cat input |grep '[xNN]'
4. Line starts with a lowercase letter
	cat input |grep ^[a-z]
5. Line is not empty
	cat input|grep -v -e '^$'
6. Line starts with a lowercase letter and ends in a number
	cat input |grep ^[a-z] $[0-9]
7. Line is longer than 50 characters
	cat input |grep -e '[^\]\{50,\}'
8. Line is of an even length
	cat input |grep grep -v '^\(..\)\+$
