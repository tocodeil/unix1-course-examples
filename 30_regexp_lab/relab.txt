Use grep to print only the lines from "input" for which:


1. There is a binary number in the line

2. There is an even binary number in the line



3. Line includes a hexadecimal number



4. Line starts with a lowercase letter


cat input | grep '^[a-z]'


5. Line is not empty


cat input | grep -v '^$'


6. Line starts with a lowercase letter and ends in a number



cat input | grep ^[a-z]
only works because I know the only lines with lowercase are the ones I actually need
7. Line is longer than 50 characters


8. Line is of an even length
